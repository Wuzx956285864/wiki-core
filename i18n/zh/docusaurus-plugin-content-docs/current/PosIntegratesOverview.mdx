| The Merchant Point of Sale (POS) application runs on the same payment terminal and pulls **CodePay Register** to accept payment requests through intent calls. | An application on a merchant's POS or electronic cash register (ECR) that sends payment requests to the payment terminal for processing. There are two communication methods for cross terminal requests:<br/><br/>1. Local network: POS applications are connected to terminals through USB cables, wireless/wired local networks<br/><br/>  2. Cloud network: POS application connects to cloud APIs and push requests to payment terminal through CodePay's IoT service<br/> |

| Advantages: Simple calls between Android applications, easy integration, fast response, independent of the stability of the transmission link connection       | Advantages: POS applications can run on third-party devices with no restrictions on the size or performance of the terminal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Disadvantage: POS applications must run on the terminal, which may involve software adaptation and modification work                                           | Disadvantage: Higher requirements for network connection stability between POS devices and payment terminals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
