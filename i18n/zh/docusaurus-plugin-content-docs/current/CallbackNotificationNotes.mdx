# Callback Notification Guidelines

## 1. Guidelines for 'notify_url' Entry:

- Ensure the notify_url is set to the actual address of the merchant's system, and not the sample address provided in the interface documentation or demo.

- The notify_url should be a fully qualified path starting with either "https\://" or "http\://". It's essential that both the domain name and IP in the URL are externally accessible.

- Avoid using local or internal IP addresses like localhost, 127.0.0.1, or 192.168.x.x for the notify_url.

- It's best practice not to append parameters to the notify_url.

Common Mistakes and Their Descriptions:

| Error \ width:50%; \\ | Example \width:50%;\\ |
| --- | --- |
| URL is only a domain without a specific path | `https://www.test.com` |
| URL lacks "https\://" or "http\://", or is missing domain name/IP | /payNotify.php |
| Local or intranet IP is used | `http://127.0.0.1/pay/notify.php` |
| Non-URL formatted strings | xxxxxxx，1234567，test |

## 2. Callback Logic Considerations:

- The processing logic for notify_url should not involve any login status or permission checks.

- Merchants must validate the signature of the notification to avoid false notifications. Additionally, cross-check the order amount in the notification against the one in the merchant's system.

- Upon receiving a payment notification, the merchant's system should acknowledge within 5 seconds. Failing to do so will lead CodePay to assume the notification attempt failed, prompting future retries.

- Merchants should anticipate the possibility of receiving the same notification multiple times. Therefore, ensure the system can handle repeated notifications without error. If a notification has already been processed, simply send a success acknowledgment to CodePay.

- If there are firewall policies limiting CodePay callback IPs on the merchant's end, be sure to whitelist the following IPs:

```
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.2
127.0.0.3
```
