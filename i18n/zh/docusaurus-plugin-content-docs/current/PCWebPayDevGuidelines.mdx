# Web Payment Integration

Merchants with online websites (e.g. online shopping malls/ticketing sites/recharge sites, etc.) can refer to the solutions provided in this section to access CodePay payments.

## Integration Instructions

E-commerce/PC Web Payment is a payment product in which a merchant displays goods or services on a web page, and when a user selects a certain payment method on the merchant's page, the browser automatically jumps to CodePay's web cashier to complete the payment. The product can be docked through the API provided by CodePay after signing the contract.

CodePay Web Cashier integrates with a large number of banks/acquirers/third-party payment service providers' web cashier, which includes bank card online payment/mobile wallet account payment/mobile wallet scanning payment and so on.

After the user completes the payment, the merchant can receive the payment notification from CodePay, and the merchant can also take the initiative to call the query order interface to get the payment result. After obtaining the payment result, then synchronize and update the order to complete the payment of goods and services.

**Usage Example**
