# Wap Payment Integration

The merchant's application is a mobile H5 web page that requires payment to be completed on handheld terminals such as mobile phones/tablets, refer to the solution provided in this section to access CodePay payments.

## Integration Instructions

Mobile web payment (also known as H5 payment) refers to the merchant displaying goods or services on the mobile web page (typically opened in mobile browsers such as Chrome, Safari, or built-in mobile browsers, as well as some mobile app built-in browsers that can also open the web page). When the user selects a payment method on the merchant page, the browser automatically redirects to the CodePay mobile web cashier to complete the payment. After signing up, the product can be connected through the API provided by CodePay.

CodePay Mobile Web Cashier integrates with a large number of banks/acquirers/third-party payment service providers' H5 web cashier, which includes bank card online payment/mobile wallet account payment/mobile wallet APP payment and so on.

After the user completes the payment, the merchant can receive the payment notification from CodePay, and the merchant can also take the initiative to call the query order interface to get the payment result. After obtaining the payment result, then synchronize and update the order to complete the payment of goods and services.

**Usage Example**

<ImageZoom src={mobileWebPayFlowImg} />
