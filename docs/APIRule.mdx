# API rule

### About API

In order to bring merchants a simple, consistent and easy-to-use development experience under the premise of payment security, we have launched a payment API with the following features

- Follow a uniform REST design style
- Using JSON as a format for data interaction
- Uses SHA256-RSA digital signature algorithm based on asymmetric key to ensure data security more efficiently

### SDK Access

We provide the official SDK or Demo of the API (currently includes Java, PHP, C# three language versions). In addition, we also provide Postman debugging tools, key generation tools, signature verification tools, you can get through our GitHub.

We recommend that merchants develop applications based on the SDK provided by the official. The SDK encapsulates the request signature and response verification for merchant technicians, simplifying the development of merchant systems.

### Self Access

In the rules description, you will learn about the basic conventions of the API, such as data format, parameter compatibility, error handling, and so on. We also focus on the authentication mechanism (key/signature) of the API. You can follow along with the development guide and practice signature generation, signature verification step by step using command line or your familiar programming language.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask us.
