# Cross-terminal application integration

## Introduction

The merchants typically utilize third-party point-of-sale (POS) devices to operate their business software, such as tablets, smartphones, PCs, or dedicated cash registers ("POS Devices") . In this scenario, **CodePay Register** can be accessed through a cross-terminal integration solution to facilitate payment processing. **CodePay Register** provides ECRHub service that supports 3 modes of cross-terminal integration:

| \ width:10% \\ | A: USB mode \ width:50% \\ | B: WLAN/LAN mode \ width:30% \\ | C: Cloud API mode \ width:30% \\ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Communication protocol** | USB cable serial protocol | WebSocket protocol | HTTP and MQTT protocol |
| **Network interaction** | <ImageZoom src={WorkflowCImg} /> | <ImageZoom src={WorkflowBImg} /> | <ImageZoom src={WorkflowDImg} /> |
| **Solution advantage** | Peer-to-peer connection, simple and reliable network, plug and play<br /><br /> Stable transmission and fast response | Better adaptability for use in a wider range of areas within the store<br /><br />Can be used for more operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, Android, IOS <br /><br />Flexible connection: Each POS terminal can be connected to multiple payment terminals, and multiple POS terminals can be connected to the same payment terminal | Flexible connection: Each POS terminal can be connected to multiple payment terminals, and multiple POS terminals can be connected to the same payment terminal.<br /><br />There are no requirements for the POS operating system |
| **Restricted condition** | One POS terminal can only connect to one payment terminal<br /><br />Terminal placement is limited by the length of the USB cable<br /><br /> POS applications only support the Windows operating system | There are high requirements for WIFI network coverage and connection stability in the store area | There are high requirements for the quality of internet access in stores |
