# QR Pay(Customer-presented)

Merchants with QR code scanning devices can refer to the solutions provided in this section to access the CodePay gateway for payment.

## Integration Instructions

If the merchant is using a POS that has a scanning gun or other device that can scan barcode/QR code, it can be connected through the "QR Pay(Customer-presented)" product provided by CodePay.

The so-called "QR Pay(Customer-presented)" means that the user opens the payment code of each mobile wallet, and the merchant uses the code-scanning device to obtain the content of the user's payment code (which is generally a string of digits or EMV-standardized character strings), and then carries the content of the payment code to request the CodePay interface to complete the deduction. In this payment mode, according to the business rules of each wallet, the password may be required, or the payment may be made directly without verifying the password (generally, small payments are free of password, and large payments are password-checked).

**Usage Example**

<ImageZoom src={codePayFlowImg} />
