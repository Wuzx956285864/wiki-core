# USB mode integration

## Introduction&#x20;

# /

**POS application** need to push order to the payment terminal in real time. They can be connected by USB cable. **POS application** send serial communication commands to **CodePay Register** ECRHub service to process payment request.

::::tip

In USB cable mode, the ECR integration solution can only supports windows OS(7 version above)

:::tip The following is the process diagram:

1. **POS application** sends order info (such as: order number, total amount etc. ) by usb serial communication command to **CodePay Register** application.
2. The checkout module of **CodePay Register** collects the bank card information/mobile wallet user credentials and processes it securely, then merges it and order information in the transaction data, and sends the payment request to payment gateway/acquire/processor/bank.
3. Payment gateway/acquire/processor/bank responses result to **CodePay Register** application.
4. **CodePay Register** send transaction result to **POS application** by serial communication command, and display payment result on the screen.

## Development guidelines

### 1. Obtain payment parameters

Before starting the integration, you need to make some preparations, the most important of which is to obtain the payment parameters required for the integration. You need to contact your project support personnel to activate payment, and the main matters are as follows:

- Register merchant stores and other information
- Purchase payment terminals and binding
- Apply to activate payment methods and sign business cooperation agreements
- Register for application development and obtain an application development app\_ ID
- Activate payment terminal, canned key (if bank card payment is required)

Please refer to the <a href="/GatewayOverview" target="_blank">Payment gateway integration guide</a>.

### 2. Connect POS to terminal

Connect your POS device and payment terminal using the accessory USB cable that comes with the purchase of the payment terminal, ensuring the correct and stable connection of the line.

### 3. Application install and setting

Please install the application "**CodePay Register**" on the Payment terminal, start the app, and click on "Settings ->General ->ECR Hub" in sequence. Set the connection mode to "USB-Cable", as shown in the following figure:

### 4. Qualcomm USB driver install

In your POS device operating system, if you have not yet installed the Qualcomm USB driver, please <a href="https://wise-paycloud.oss-eu-west-1.aliyuncs.com/test/codepayResource/qud.win.1.1_installer_10065.1.zip?OSSAccessKeyId=LTAI5tDS7q4RHauowRMYsUPz&Expires=1796441922&Signature=fgH95eIngQDSUCyfmp%2B8BD4G9iE%3D" target="_blank">click here</a> to download the installation package. After installation, check whether the installation is successful by using the following method

On Windows PC, please open 'Device Manager' and check whether 'Android GPS 9020(virtual port)' exists.

### 5. Access our APIs

#### Integration with Register-SDK

We provide a <a href="/CodePayRegisterSDK" target="_blank">Rapid integration with Register-SDK under local network</a>. Currently, the SDK supports the following two programming languages

We recommend developers to use Register-SDK which secondary packages the communication protocol layer. SDK can help developers quickly complete application payment integration. In addition, we also provide <a href="https://github.com/paycloud-open/ecrhub-client-demo-java" target="_blank">sample code</a> , and you can obtain their source code and latest version information through our GitHub.

#### 2. Integration with APIs

If the above SDK cannot meet your needs, or if you need deeper control over product details, you can refer to our API specifications and write your own code.

## Product experience

The following example demonstrates the complete process of customers selecting and placing orders for goods from the POS system, using **CodePay Register** for payment, and then returning to the POS system. Merchants can refer to this example to design your product and technical implementation plan.The following example demonstrates the complete process of customers selecting and placing orders for goods from the POS system, using **CodePay Register** for payment, and then returning to the POS system.
