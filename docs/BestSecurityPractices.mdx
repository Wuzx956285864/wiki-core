# Best Security Practices

## 1. Safe Use Of Merchant Platforms

For the safe use of the merchant platform, we will start from four aspects: applying for the account, receiving the account opening email, logging in to the merchant platform, and the daily use of the merchant platform.

### 1.1 Account Application

     a、Applying to CodePay is free; be wary of potential scams.

     b、After submitting your application, securely store the details to avoid breaches.

### 1.2 Account Activation Email

     a、Keep your activation email, which contains sensitive information like your account ID and initial password, in a secure location.

### 1.3 Logging into the Merchant Platform

     a、Upon first login, change your password. It should be a minimum of 8 characters, using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

     b、Always ensure you're logging in via https://mp.codepay.us to avoid phishing attacks.

### 1.4 Daily Platform Use

    a、Login Security

    ◆ Update your password every three months.
    ◆ Safeguard your email account, as it's used for sensitive operations like funding.
    ◆ Assign unique roles and privileges to operators and limit them as needed.
    ◆ Revoke privileges when employees leave or change roles.
    ◆ Each employee should have an individual account—no sharing.

    b、Browser Safety

    ◆ Use updated browsers and enable automatic system and browser updates.

    c、Functionality

    ◆ If using APIs, consider setting up an IP whitelist.

## 2. System Development Guidelines

For merchants who are keen on developing information systems, whether managed in-house or outsourced, security is paramount. We'll outline these considerations under five main sections: requirements, design, coding, testing, and deployment & operations maintenance.

### 2.1 Requirements

    a、When creating marketing campaigns internally, it's crucial to incorporate anti-scratch mechanisms.

### 2.2 Design

    a、Data Acquisition
    ◆ Avoid capturing data types that are legally restricted, like magnetic track details and credit card CVV codes.
    ◆ Sensitive client information should always be encrypted before storage.

    b、Data Transmission
    ◆ Rely on HTTPS protocols to ensure secure online communications.
    ◆ Avoid outdated protocols. Using updated versions, such as TLS 1.2, is advisable.
    ◆ Designing and implementing personal encryption strategies should be approached with caution; they often come with pitfalls.

    c、Data Retention
    ◆ Ensure logs do not display sensitive data. If required, this data should be desensitized.
    ◆ Encryption or hashing is essential for sensitive data stored in caches or databases.
    ◆ Store essential authentication details, like passwords, using salted hashes.

    d、Data Access
    ◆ All external data access requests should undergo authentication.
    ◆ It's essential to keep internal data access highly restricted to prevent unintended leaks.

    e、Audit Logs
    ◆ Comprehensive logging is crucial, capturing Who, When, Why, How, and What details.

    f、Handling Finances
    ◆ Consistently reconcile system and CodePay financial data.
    ◆ Design data systems like databases or key-value stores to guard against unauthorized data alterations.

### 2.3 Coding

    a、Parameter Handling
    ◆ Maintain an up-to-date security vulnerability checklist.
    ◆ Proactively detect and rectify system and web vulnerabilities.
    ◆ Stay abreast of the newest solutions for security vulnerabilities.

    b、Logic Handling
    ◆ Ensure that payment confirmation notifications are validated against CodePay signatures.
    ◆ Backend commodity pricing logic should safeguard against potential front-end price tampering.
    ◆ Keep sensitive details like merchant API keys or certificates away from public-facing apps or web pages.

    c、App Development Security
    ◆ For iOS development, adhere to Apple's security best practices.
    ◆ For Android, follow the recommended security guidelines.

### 2.4 Testing

     a、Conduct rigorous safety testing for both input and output parameters.

     b、Regularly scan the system for vulnerabilities, utilizing in-house resources, crowdsourcing, or third-party security tools, and address identified issues promptly.

### 2.5 Deployment & Operations

     a、Use the latest stable versions for all system components, both commercial and open-source.

     b、Conduct system vulnerability tests periodically and rectify any issues.

     c、Have a disaster recovery plan in place, complete with primary backups. Ideally, distribute deployments across several server rooms or locations.

     d、Utilize major cloud platforms, activating their built-in security measures.

     e、If resources allow, invest in dedicated security monitoring tools or services.

     f、Monitor real-time data with established key metrics.

     g、Have designated staff to oversee and address security incidents.

     h、Keep tabs on the security health of all system frameworks and components.

     i、Regularly patch and upgrade the system to its latest version.

     j、Practice restraint when opening service ports.

     k、Ensure all server login activities are traceable.

     m、The internal management system should mandate authentication and maintain operation logs for audit purposes.

     n、Reduce the system's vulnerability by minimizing offline business operations.
